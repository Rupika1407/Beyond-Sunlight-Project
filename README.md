Problem statement : Earth's ecosystems heavily rely on sunlight, but imagine an ocean world where chemosynthesis, not photosynthesis, sustains life. Your challenge is to design such a world and its diverse ecosystem, pushing the boundaries of astrobiology beyond traditional Earth-like conditions.
The dataset used for this contains chemical compounds that are used by organisms in underwater in deep ocean for chemosynthesis.The details about the Hydrothermal vent which acts like a host for the organisms to carry out chemosynthesis.The python file contains code that cleans the data,performs feature extraction and basic visualizations that helps to understand the relationship between the features.
